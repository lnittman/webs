## Current State
The Webs project has evolved into a monorepo structure with two main components: a CLI tool and a web application. The CLI tool is functional but has dependency issues with `@prisma/client`. The web application has been initialized with Next.js, but there are integration challenges between the two components.

## Progress Made
- Created a monorepo structure with `packages/cli` and `packages/web` directories
- Set up a new Next.js application in the `packages/web` directory with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint
- Installed essential dependencies for the web application including UI libraries, authentication, and AI integration
- Initialized Prisma in both the root project and the web application
- Attempted to create a database schema that works for both the CLI tool and the web application

## Decisions
- **Monorepo Structure**: Decided to organize the project as a monorepo to separate the CLI tool from the web application while allowing them to share common code and dependencies
- **Database Strategy**: Chose SQLite for development simplicity, with a schema that supports both the CLI tool's needs and the web application's more complex requirements
- **Technology Stack**: Selected Next.js with App Router, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma for the web application to align with modern web development practices
- **Dependency Management**: Installed dependencies at both the root level and in the web application to ensure proper functioning of both components

## Challenges
- **Module Resolution**: Encountered issues with the CLI tool not finding the `@prisma/client` module
- **Prisma Schema Generation**: Faced difficulties in generating the Prisma client due to schema file issues
- **Project Structure Mismatch**: The existing CLI tool structure doesn't align perfectly with the Next.js application structure
- **Environment Configuration**: Need to manage environment variables for both the CLI tool and the web application

## Next Steps
1. **Fix CLI Dependencies**:
   - Ensure `@prisma/client` is properly installed and accessible to the CLI tool
   - Update the CLI tool's database module to work with the new Prisma schema

2. **Complete Web Application Setup**:
   - Finalize the Prisma schema for the web application
   - Set up authentication with NextAuth.js
   - Create the basic UI components (layout, navigation, etc.)

3. **Integration Strategy**:
   - Develop a shared library for common functionality between CLI and web
   - Create an API layer in the web application that the CLI can interact with

4. **Database Migration**:
   - Create a migration strategy to move data from the CLI's SQLite database to the web application's database
   - Implement database versioning and schema migrations

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update the README with instructions for both the CLI tool and the web application
   - Document the monorepo structure and how the components interact

6. **Testing**:
   - Set up testing for both the CLI tool and the web application
   - Create integration tests to ensure the components work together correctly
