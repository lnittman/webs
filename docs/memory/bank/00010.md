## Current State
The web CLI tool has been enhanced with a token estimation feature in the `copy` command. This feature analyzes the copied content and provides users with an approximate token count, helping them understand how much of their LLM's context window the content will consume when pasted.

## Progress Made
- Created a token estimation utility module with per-model approximations
- Integrated token counting into the `copy` command output
- Added visual indicators of token count size (very small, small, medium, large, etc.)
- Implemented model-specific token estimation for different LLM families
- Enhanced the copy command to display both overall and model-specific estimates
- Improved the summary generation for the copy command

## Decisions
- **Estimation Method**: Used a hybrid approach combining character count and word count for more accurate estimates
- **Model-Specific Estimates**: Implemented different token/character ratios for various LLM families (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- **Visual Format**: Created a user-friendly format that includes token count, word count, character count, and a size descriptor
- **Display Logic**: Show detailed model breakdowns only for larger content (>1000 tokens) to avoid cluttering the output
- **Summary Preparation**: Improved the content preparation for summaries to focus on titles and excerpts

## Challenges
- Token counting is an approximation since exact counts depend on model-specific tokenizers
- Different models tokenize text differently, requiring model-family approximations
- Balancing detail with usability in how the token information is presented
- Handling edge cases like very short or very large content

## Next Steps
- Consider adding a more precise tokenization for specific models if needed
- Add a warning when content exceeds common context limits (8K, 16K, 32K tokens)
- Allow users to specify their target model to get more precise estimates
- Consider adding token estimation to other commands (list, stats)
- Add an option to include/exclude token information from the output
- Potentially create a standalone token counting command
