## Current State
The Webs project has evolved significantly, with both a mature CLI tool and a modern web application in development. The CLI tool provides robust functionality for fetching, storing, and interacting with web content via r.jina.ai, while the web application offers a user-friendly interface with advanced features like workspaces, semantic search, and AI-powered chat. The project now uses Next.js with the App Router, Prisma with PostgreSQL (via Neon DB), and integrates with Vercel AI SDK for streaming responses.

## Progress Made
- Created a comprehensive Next.js application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the App Router
- Set up a Prisma schema with models for users, workspaces, pages, links, and summaries
- Implemented vector embeddings for semantic search capabilities
- Created authentication using NextAuth with multiple provider options
- Developed API routes for fetching content, searching, and chat functionality
- Implemented streaming responses for AI interactions using Vercel AI SDK
- Created UI components including the landing page, dashboard, and workspace views
- Set up theme switching with light/dark mode support
- Integrated with OpenRouter for access to various AI models

## Decisions
- **Database Structure**: Designed a relational database schema that supports multi-user workspaces and collaborative content management
- **Vector Search**: Implemented vector embeddings for semantic search to enable natural language queries across content
- **Authentication Strategy**: Used NextAuth with multiple providers (Google, GitHub, Email) for flexible authentication options
- **UI Framework**: Selected shadcn/ui components for a clean, accessible interface with consistent styling
- **API Design**: Created RESTful API endpoints with proper authentication checks and error handling
- **AI Integration**: Used OpenRouter to provide access to multiple AI models with a consistent interface
- **Streaming Responses**: Implemented streaming for chat responses to improve user experience with real-time feedback

## Challenges
- Managing vector embeddings in PostgreSQL requires special handling
- Ensuring proper authentication and authorization across all API routes
- Balancing between client and server components in the Next.js App Router
- Handling rate limiting and error cases for external API calls
- Ensuring responsive design across different device sizes
- Managing token limits when sending content to AI models

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Chat Interface**:
   - Implement a streaming chat interface with message history
   - Add model selection dropdown
   - Create context controls for focusing on specific domains/workspaces

2. **Enhance Content Fetching**:
   - Build a user-friendly interface for URL input with depth controls
   - Implement progress indicators for fetch operations
   - Add support for batch URL processing

3. **Improve Search Experience**:
   - Create an advanced search interface with filters
   - Implement search result highlighting
   - Add faceted search options (by domain, date, etc.)

4. **Content Visualization**:
   - Implement a graph visualization for content relationships
   - Add domain and path tree views
   - Create content preview with syntax highlighting

5. **User Management**:
   - Complete user settings and profile pages
   - Implement workspace invitation system
   - Add user role management

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed content
   - Add pagination for large result sets
   - Optimize vector search performance

7. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure Docker for containerized deployment
   - Implement monitoring and logging

8. **PWA Features**:
   - Add service worker for offline capabilities
   - Implement app manifest for installable experience
   - Add push notifications for collaborative features
