## Current State
The web CLI tool has been enhanced with a new feature that generates human-readable summaries of content using AI. This feature connects to OpenRouter API and uses Google's Gemini-2-Flash-001 model to create structured summaries of fetched content. The implementation includes caching to optimize API usage and provide faster responses for previously summarized content.

## Progress Made
- Added the `--summary` flag to the CLI interface
- Implemented a summarizer module that interacts with OpenRouter API
- Created a caching mechanism for optimizing summary generation
- Added a `--no-cache` option to bypass the cache when needed
- Extended the DatabaseManager with a getLinksBySourceId method
- Implemented structured display of summary results in the CLI

## Decisions
- **AI Model Selection**: Chose Google's Gemini-2-Flash-001 via OpenRouter for its speed and quality in generating structured summaries
- **Caching Strategy**: Implemented both in-memory caching and file-based caching with a 24-hour expiration to balance performance and freshness
- **Content Preparation**: Created a strategy to limit content size to avoid token limits while preserving the most important information
- **Structured Output**: Defined a standardized JSON response format to ensure consistent presentation in the CLI

## Challenges
- Needed to manage token limits when sending content to the OpenRouter API
- Had to handle potential API errors and rate limiting gracefully
- Required careful design of the cache invalidation strategy
- Had to ensure the feature would work even when some pages fail to fetch

## Next Steps
- Further optimize the content selection for summary generation
- Add support for exporting summaries to different formats (Markdown, HTML, etc.)
- Implement rate limiting detection and backoff for the OpenRouter API
- Consider adding options to customize the summarization parameters
- Add unit tests for the summarizer and cache functionality
- Document the summary feature in the README
