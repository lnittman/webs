## Current State
The web CLI tool has been enhanced with a new `list` command that allows users to view and search URLs that have been indexed in the database. This provides a way to browse the content that has been fetched and stored, making the tool more useful for content management. The CLI structure has also been reorganized to use subcommands for better scalability.

## Progress Made
- Added a new `list` command to the CLI interface
- Implemented the `getAllPages` method in the `DatabaseManager` class to retrieve indexed URLs
- Added filtering capabilities with the `-s, --search` option
- Implemented multiple output formats (table, JSON, simple) with the `-f, --format` option
- Added a limit option to control the number of results displayed
- Updated the CLI structure to use proper subcommands with `fetch` as the default command
- Updated the documentation to reflect the new command and options

## Decisions
- **Command Structure**: Reorganized the CLI to use subcommands (`fetch`, `list`) for better organization and future extensibility
- **Table Format**: Created a table format for the default output that shows ID, URL, title, and fetch date in a clean, aligned format
- **Content Limiting**: Limited the content field in the database query to avoid fetching large amounts of data unnecessarily
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained backward compatibility by setting `fetch` as the default command

## Challenges
- Needed to handle potentially very long URLs and titles in table output by implementing truncation
- Had to ensure proper column alignment in table format regardless of content lengths
- Required special handling for type definitions to fix TypeScript errors

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more advanced search options (date ranges, content search)
- Add a `show` command to display the full content of a specific page
- Consider implementing export functionality to save search results to a file
- Add a `delete` command to remove URLs from the database
- Implement pagination for the list results when there are many entries
- Add sorting options for the list command
