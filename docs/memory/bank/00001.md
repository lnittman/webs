## Current State
Initial implementation of the web CLI tool is complete with core functionality. The tool can fetch content from r.jina.ai, extract links, and store data in a SQLite database. However, there are dependency issues that need to be resolved before the tool can be used properly.

## Progress Made
- Created project structure with TypeScript setup
- Implemented database module with SQLite schema using better-sqlite3
- Developed fetcher module to interact with r.jina.ai
- Created parser module to extract links from markdown content
- Built queue system for handling recursive fetching of links
- Implemented CLI interface with Commander.js
- Added loading indicators and proper error handling
- Created comprehensive documentation including README and memory bank

## Decisions
- **Module System**: Started with ES Modules but switched to CommonJS due to compatibility issues with certain dependencies.
- **Markdown Parser**: Initially used unified/remark for markdown parsing but encountered ESM compatibility issues. Switched to markdown-it which is more compatible with CommonJS.
- **Database Location**: Decided to store the SQLite database in the user's home directory (~/.web-cli) for persistence and to avoid cluttering project directories.
- **Deduplication Strategy**: Implemented URL-based deduplication to ensure we don't process or store the same content multiple times.
- **CLI Design**: Used dog emoji (üê∂) as the tool's icon and implemented a clean, lowercase aesthetic throughout the interface.

## Challenges
- **ESM vs CommonJS**: Struggled with module compatibility issues, particularly with unified/remark libraries which are ESM-only.
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Had to adjust TypeScript configuration to properly support CommonJS modules.
- **Optional Chaining Assignment**: Fixed TypeScript errors related to optional property access assignments in the queue.ts file.
- **Type Declarations**: Needed to add various type declaration dependencies for third-party libraries.

## Next Steps
- Finish resolving dependency issues, particularly with the markdown parser
- Run a complete test of the CLI tool with a real URL
- Implement unit tests for critical functionality
- Consider adding a flag to control the database location
- Add support for exporting stored content to other formats
- Improve error handling for network issues or rate limiting from r.jina.ai
- Update memory bank with results from testing
