## Current State
The web CLI tool has been enhanced with a new `copy` command that allows users to copy content from indexed URLs to their clipboard. This feature makes it easy to access and use the content that has been fetched and stored in the database without having to manually browse files or query the database.

## Progress Made
- Added the `clipboardy` package for clipboard integration
- Implemented the `copy` command to extract content by domain and optional path
- Enhanced the `DatabaseManager` with methods to retrieve and format content
- Added options for including titles and fetch dates in the copied content
- Implemented multiple output formats (markdown, text, JSON) for flexibility
- Created a clean interface with progress indicators and feedback
- Updated documentation to reflect the new command and options

## Decisions
- **Command Interface**: Designed a simple interface where users can specify a domain and an optional path using the format `domain[/path]`
- **Content Formatting**: Created multiple format options (markdown, text, JSON) to cater to different use cases
- **Library Selection**: Initially selected clipboardy v3, but downgraded to v2.3.0 due to ESM compatibility issues with our CommonJS setup
- **Content Retrieval**: Implemented efficient SQL queries to retrieve content by domain and path patterns
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Added progress indicators and clear success/failure messages for better user experience

## Challenges
- Encountered ESM compatibility issues with the clipboardy v3 package
- Needed to handle the parsing of the target argument into domain and path components
- Had to ensure efficient content retrieval when dealing with potentially many pages
- Required careful handling of content formatting for different output formats

## Next Steps
- Consider adding an option to copy only a subset of the content (e.g., first N characters)
- Add support for copying content to a file instead of just the clipboard
- Implement a preview option to see what will be copied before actually copying
- Consider adding a `--limit` option to control the number of pages copied
- Add support for filtering content by date
- Consider using a pager for large content previews
