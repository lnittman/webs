# Memory Entry 00002

## Date
2025-03-10

## Current State
The web CLI tool is now successfully built and operational. Dependency issues have been resolved, and the CLI tool is working as expected, with all components properly integrated. The memory bank has been properly structured according to requirements.

## Progress Made
- Successfully resolved all dependency and build issues
- Completed the transition from unified/remark to markdown-it for markdown parsing
- Verified the CLI tool works by testing the help command
- Created a proper memory bank structure with init.md and organized entries
- Set up the CLI tool globally via npm link

## Decisions
- **Memory Bank Structure**: Implemented a structured memory bank with init.md documentation and a bank/ directory for chronological entries, following best practices for LLM-driven development.
- **Dependency Management**: Confirmed that all dependencies are properly configured and compatible with CommonJS.

## Challenges
- None significant in this phase. The major challenges from the previous entry were successfully resolved.

## Next Steps
- Test the CLI with actual URLs to verify content fetching and link extraction
- Monitor for any rate limiting from r.jina.ai during extensive use
- Add unit tests for core functionality
- Consider implementing additional features:
  - Content search within the database
  - Export functionality to different formats
  - Visualization of link relationships
- Update memory bank with results from real-world testing
