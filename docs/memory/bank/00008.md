## Current State
The web CLI tool has been enhanced with a dog-themed summary feature that automatically generates friendly, dog-themed summaries of content using Google's Gemini-2-Flash-001 model. This feature is enabled by default for both the `list` and `copy` commands, adding a fun and informative layer to the user experience while maintaining the dog emoji theme of the CLI.

## Progress Made
- Created a new `ai-summary.ts` module for generating dog-themed summaries
- Integrated the summary feature with both the `list` and `copy` commands
- Added content gathering logic for different display formats and contexts
- Implemented a user-friendly prompt template for the dog persona
- Added formatting for improved readability of the generated summaries
- Added option flags to disable the dog summary feature if desired
- Updated documentation to reflect the new functionality

## Decisions
- **Dog Persona**: Created a friendly, intelligent dog persona called "Web Retriever" to provide summaries in a fun, engaging voice
- **Default Behavior**: Made the summary feature enabled by default but allowed users to disable it with a flag
- **Content Preparation**: Customized content preparation for different command contexts to ensure relevant information is included in the summary
- **Output Formatting**: Styled the summary output with yellow color and indentation for better readability
- **Error Handling**: Added graceful fallbacks when the API key is missing or the API call fails

## Challenges
- Needed to customize content preparation for different command contexts (list, copy)
- Had to manage potentially large content sizes by implementing truncation
- Required careful prompt design to balance fun dog persona with informational value
- Needed to handle potential missing API keys with friendly error messages

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing different dog personas or moods for variety
- Add more intelligence to content preparation to improve summary quality
- Implement caching for summaries to reduce API calls
- Add more contextual awareness to the summaries based on command and content
- Consider adding a standalone "summarize" command for summarizing arbitrary content
