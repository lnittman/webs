# Memory Entry 00003

## Current State
The web CLI tool has been successfully tested with a real URL (example.com). The tool correctly fetched the content, stored it in the SQLite database, and identified links within the content as expected. The core functionality is fully operational.

## Progress Made
- Successfully tested the CLI tool with a real URL
- Confirmed proper content fetching from r.jina.ai
- Verified database storage is working correctly
- Observed proper link extraction functionality
- Noticed one deprecation warning related to the punycode module (not critical)

## Decisions
- Used a depth of 0 for initial testing to avoid excessive requests and potential rate limiting

## Challenges
- Observed a deprecation warning about the punycode module, which is used by one of our dependencies. This is not critical but should be noted for future maintenance.

## Next Steps
- Test with more complex URLs and varying depth levels
- Consider implementing a rate limiting strategy when fetching multiple pages
- Add a database query command to view stored content
- Add unit tests for the core modules
- Address the punycode deprecation warning in a future update
- Create comprehensive usage examples
