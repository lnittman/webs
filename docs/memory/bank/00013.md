## Current State
The Webs project has been successfully reorganized into a monorepo structure with three main components: a CLI tool (`packages/cli`), a web application (`packages/web`), and a shared library (`packages/shared`). The shared library provides common functionality that can be used by both the CLI tool and the web application, including database operations, content fetching, and queue processing.

## Progress Made
- Organized the project into a proper monorepo structure
- Moved the CLI code to `packages/cli` directory
- Set up the Next.js web application in `packages/web` directory
- Created a shared library in `packages/shared` with:
  - Common database operations using Prisma
  - Content fetching functionality from r.jina.ai
  - Queue processing for recursive content fetching
  - Shared TypeScript interfaces and types
- Enhanced the Prisma schema to support both CLI and web application needs
- Added support for workspaces and users in the database schema
- Created a unified approach to database operations across both applications

## Decisions
- **Shared Library Architecture**: Created a central shared library to avoid code duplication and ensure consistency between the CLI and web application
- **Enhanced Schema Design**: Extended the database schema to support multi-user workspaces while maintaining backward compatibility with the CLI
- **TypeScript Integration**: Used TypeScript for type safety across all components
- **Modular Approach**: Separated concerns into distinct modules (database, fetcher, queue) for better maintainability

## Challenges
- Ensuring backward compatibility of the database schema with existing CLI functionality
- Managing dependencies across multiple packages in the monorepo
- Balancing the needs of both the CLI tool (simplicity, performance) and the web application (rich features, multi-user support)
- Maintaining type safety across package boundaries

## Next Steps
1. **CLI Integration**:
   - Update the CLI code to use the shared library
   - Test CLI functionality with the new architecture
   - Ensure compatibility with existing data

2. **Web Application Development**:
   - Implement API routes for content fetching, searching, and chat
   - Create UI components for workspaces, content browsing, and search
   - Set up authentication with NextAuth.js

3. **Database Migration**:
   - Create a migration script to move data from the old format to the new format
   - Implement database versioning

4. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive tests for all components
   - Update documentation with monorepo setup instructions
   - Create examples of how to use the shared library

5. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for the monorepo
   - Create Docker configurations for the web application
   - Publish the CLI tool to npm
