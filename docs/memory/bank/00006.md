## Current State
The `list` command has been completely redesigned to provide a domain-focused navigation experience. The tool now groups content by domain names, allowing users to easily browse through different websites and see their content organized in a tree/directory structure. This makes it much easier to navigate and understand the relationships between pages within a website.

## Progress Made
- Reimagined the list command to focus on domain-level navigation
- Implemented domain name extraction to show the main part between "www." and ".domain"
- Added a tree view that organizes URLs by their path structure
- Created a hierarchical visualization of website content
- Added new command options (`--all`, `--domain`, `--tree`) for different views
- Implemented helper functions for URL parsing and tree rendering
- Updated documentation to reflect the new navigation approach

## Decisions
- **Domain Extraction**: Implemented a technique to extract just the main part of the domain name for easier navigation
- **Tree Visualization**: Created an ASCII tree visualization to show the hierarchical structure of website content
- **Default View**: Changed the default view to show domains first, then allow drilling down into specific domains
- **Path-Based Organization**: Organized URLs within a domain by their path structure to create a directory-like view
- **Visual Styling**: Added color coding and formatting to improve readability and navigation

## Challenges
- Needed to parse URLs correctly to extract domain names and paths
- Had to develop a tree-building algorithm to organize URLs hierarchically
- Required special handling for root paths and long domain names
- Needed to create a visually appealing tree structure with proper indentation and connectors

## Next Steps
- Implement interactive navigation with actual arrow key support
- Add ability to select a domain/URL and show its content
- Consider adding pagination for domains with many pages
- Add sorting options for the domain list
- Implement filtering options within a domain
- Add a search command to look for content across domains
